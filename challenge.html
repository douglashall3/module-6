    <h1>3D Printing</h1>

    <p>Let's have a look at high-level steps to get from a model to a 3D printed
        part. The steps necessary are roughly as follows.</p>

    <h2>Slicing</h2>

    <p><abbr title="Fused Deposition Modeling">FDM</abbr> 3D printers are one of
        several methods for additive manufacturing, and print parts layer by
        layer, advancing in height with each layer. "Slicing" takes a model, and
        parameters specific to the printer and filament as input, and produces a
        set of instructions necessary for the printer to create the part
        layer-by-layer.
    </p>

    <p>We'll use <a
           href="https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer">OrcaSlicer</a>, an
        open-source slicer, and some profiles specific to my printer and the
        filament I'll be printing the part in. The part is an adapter between an
        M20 thread on a GNSS antenna to a 1/4-20 heatset insert for mounting on
        a tripod. Since I have profiles tuned to my printer and the <a
           href="https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/asa-cf">black ASA-CF</a>
        I'll be printing it in, it's as simple as opening the model in
        OrcaSlicer and hitting "Slice plate."</p>

    <div>
        <figure>
            <a href="https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Trident"><img
                     src="resources/printer.webp"
                     alt="Voron Trident 300m Printer" height="319"></a>
            <figcaption>Figure 3. Voron Trident 300mm</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>We'll be printing the sliced part on a Voron Trident as pictured to
            the left. This is an open-source printer design anybody can source
            components for and build.</p>

        <p>Before we can start the print, the printer needs to be warmed up.
            We'll start by homing the printer in all three axes, move the bed to
            a Z-height of 100mm so bed heats the chamber fairly evenly and
            start heating the bed to 100&deg;C. Ideally the printer is allowed
            to heat-soak for some time before printing to reduce thermal
            expansion and part warping during the print. I've found a good rule
            of thumb is that the printer is stable enough once the chamber
            reaches 38&deg;C.</p>

        <p>Once up to temperature the print can be started. We'll assume the
            filament is sufficiently dry and no purging is necessary. The
            printer runs through a series of steps as follows:</p>
    </div>

    <ol>
        <li>Homing All Axes</li>
        <li>Nozzle Scrub</li>
        <li>Bed Level</li>
        <li>Bed Mesh Height Map</li>
        <li>Heat Hotend</li>
        <li>Nozzle Scrub</li>
        <li>Print Start</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Total cost and time for this print are approximately:</p>

    <table>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <th scope="row">Total Filament:</th>
                <td align="right">25.03 g</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th scope="row">Filament Cost:</th>
                <td align="right">$1.16</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th scope="row">Print Time:</th>
                <td align="right">1h 14m</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Once the print is complete, the heatset insert can be installed and we
        have a finished part.</p>
